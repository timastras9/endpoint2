3. **Include practical examples** - Working payloads, commands, or test cases
4. **Provide validation methods** - How to confirm findings and avoid false positives
5. **Submit via PR** with clear description

## 🔧 Contributing Code

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create an issue first** - Describe the problem or feature
2. **Fork and branch** - Work from the `main` branch
3. **Make your changes** - Follow existing code style
4. **Write/update tests** - Ensure coverage for new features
5. **Run quality checks** - `make check-all` should pass
6. **Submit PR** - Link to issue and provide context

### PR Guidelines

- **Clear description** - Explain what and why
- **Small, focused changes** - One feature/fix per PR
- **Include examples** - Show before/after behavior
- **Update documentation** - If adding features
- **Pass all checks** - Tests, linting, type checking

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 with 100-character line limit
